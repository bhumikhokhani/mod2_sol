                <h2>Ramanujan</h2>
                <p>
                    Srinivasa Ramanujan was an Indian mathematician who lived during the British Rule in India.
                    Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, including solutions to mathematical problems then considered unsolvable.

                <h2>Aryabhata</h2>
                <p>
                    Aryabhata was the first of the major mathematician-astronomers from the classical age of Indian mathematics and Indian astronomy.
                    His works include the Āryabhaṭīya (which mentions that in 3600 Kaliyuga, 499 CE, he was 23 years old) and the Arya-siddhanta.
                    For his explicit mention of the relativity of motion, he also qualifies as a major early physicist.

                <h2>Brahmagupta</h2>
                <p>
                    Brahmagupta was an Indian mathematician and astronomer. 
                    He is the author of three early works on mathematics and astronomy: the Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta, a theoretical treatise, and the Khaṇḍakhādyaka, a more practical text.
                    Brahmagupta was the first to give rules to compute with zero.
                    The texts composed by Brahmagupta were in elliptic verse in Sanskrit.
